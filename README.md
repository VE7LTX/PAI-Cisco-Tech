# Cisco IOS Command Processor

This Python script processes a list of Cisco IOS commands and interacts with a hypothetical GPT model to generate corresponding questions and answers.

## Usage

1. Run the main Python script `main.py`:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    The script will iterate over each command in the `cisco_ios_commands` list, generate questions, get answers from the GPT model, and save the responses.

## List of Commands

The script uses a list of Cisco IOS commands as input, named `cisco_ios_commands`. The list contains multiple commands that are common in Cisco IOS.

Please refer to the `main.py` file to see the full list of commands.

## Requirements

You need to have Python installed on your system to run this script.
